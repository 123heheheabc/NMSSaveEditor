# Change Log

## 1.5.4 - Update (28 July 2018)

- Added Delete Ship button (BE CAREFUL!).
- Updated item viewer to show the correct ID for procedural technology.
- Updated the planetary base backup/restore function to support NEXT bases.

**PLEASE NOTE:**

- Players who previously backed up their bases pre-NEXT should be able to restore their bases from file (choose "All" in the file selection dialog). This will automatically create a new main room structure, a teleporter, a doorway/ramp, and a few windows where things used to be in your old base.
- The base restore function does not support terrain modifications (yet), so there is still an issue where terrain can bleed through the floor, especially with bases built underground.

## 1.5.3 - Update (27 July 2018)

- Updated for NMS 1.51.
- Updated the items database and fixed item categories.
- Updated NPC races list to detect new models.
- Added base selection box to the Base Information tab, to allow users to view all bases, not just the first one.

## 1.5.2 - Update (26 July 2018)

- Updated exosuit and ship health to new max levels (was changed in NEXT).
- Temporarily removed freighter NPCs from editor.

## 1.5.1 - Update (26 July 2018)

- Added procedural technology to the items list (tech bought from vendors and installed).
- Temporarily disabled the base backup/restore functionality (work in progress).


## 1.5.0 - First release for NEXT

- Updated items database for No Man's Sky 1.5 (NEXT).
- Added Nanites and Quicksilver fields to Exosuit tab.
