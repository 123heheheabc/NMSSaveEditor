- Added an Unlearn All button for learned words.

## 1.5.8 - Update (31 July 2018)

- Changed Known Words Learn All function to only learn the words that are actually used by each race.

## 1.5.7 - Update (30 July 2018)

- Updated frigate management to filter traits based on frigate type.
- Set limit on number of frigates to 30 (this is the in-game limit).
- Changed Copy button to create frigates with new random seed value and no name.

## 1.5.6 - Update (30 July 2018)

- Added ability to manage frigates and their stats.
- Added home system seed field to freighters.

## 1.5.5 - Update (29 July 2018)

- Added a save file recovery feature for saves that are corrupted in-game.
- Added a check to ensure that an invalid ship index produced by the game doesn't impact the editor.

## 1.5.4 - Update (28 July 2018)

- Added Delete Ship button (BE CAREFUL!).
- Updated item viewer to show the correct ID for procedural technology.
- Updated the planetary base backup/restore function to support NEXT bases.

**PLEASE NOTE:**

- Players who previously backed up their bases pre-NEXT should be able to restore their bases from file (choose "All" in the file selection dialog). This will automatically create a new main room structure, a teleporter, a doorway/ramp, and a few windows where things used to be in your old base.
- The base restore function does not support terrain modifications (yet), so there is still an issue where terrain can bleed through the floor, especially with bases built underground.

- Updated for NMS 1.51.
- Updated the items database and fixed item categories.
- Updated NPC races list to detect new models.

- Updated exosuit and ship health to new max levels (was changed in NEXT).
- Temporarily removed freighter NPCs from editor.

## 1.5.1 - Update (26 July 2018)

## 1.5.0 - First release for NEXT
